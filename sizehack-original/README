About
-----

Ballz was written for the SizeHack 2000 competition. Basically,
you have to bounce all the green balls into the spiral thing
by colliding into them. If you collide with the spiral when it's
yellow, you die. It'll turn purple when you kill all the green
guys, then you can go into it to go to the next level.

I planned on adding some powerups and obstacles, but ran out of
space and I want to keep the code clean. The game is still fun
anyway. No sound either.


Controls
--------

Left Arrow   or  Joypad left      --  Rotate counter-clockwise
Right Arrow  or  Joypad right     --  Rotate clockwise
Up Arrow     or  Joypad button 1  --  Move forward
Escape                            --  Quit
P                                 --  Pause


Known bugs
----------

There was a bug where balls would get stuck on walls (until you
bounce them) or bounce off in the wrong direction. I think I fixed
it but it still might happen every so often.

Once a ball starts bouncing, it never stops, but I don't really
care about this one :).
